This repository demonstrates a common error in Ruby's `method_missing` method.  The `bug.rb` file shows an incorrect implementation that silently returns `nil` when a method is not found. This can lead to unexpected behavior and difficult-to-debug issues because the calling code might not realize the method was not called correctly.  The `bugSolution.rb` demonstrates the corrected version that appropriately raises a `NoMethodError`, improving error handling.
